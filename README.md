# Race Line Optimizer
## This is a code sample from the KSU Electric Vehicle Team's autonomous stack.
This is a program which I wrote for the team's kart competing in the Autonomous Karting Series (AKS).
It is not meant to be used outside of the high-level autonomy stack as intended, it is on my GitHub to showcase my ability to program with Python and ROS2.
This uses the aforementioned tools to take in a set of GPS points representing the midline of a race track, and uses parametric splines to reduce the overall curvature of the path, making it a more efficient path to take during a race.
